### 3. **Question 1.3:** 
_Compare the report from the two works. Discuss how well they support the HAI design evaluation, including both their usefulness and limitations. [10] Explain how the design patterns help realize those design guidelines. Discuss if there is any aspect you find missing from either the guideline or design pattern to reveal the quality of the HAI design of the product. [10]_


## Task-2
### 1. **Question 2.1:** 
_Revisit the user stories you wrote in Assignment 1. Discuss what kind of decisions (big or small) its users need to make during interaction when trying to achieve their goals. Explain what the decision is, what knowledge is required to make the decision, and how much effort is needed to make such decisions. [10]_

### 2. **Question 2.2:**

Explain how the design of the product exacerbates or alleviates each of the users' biases. [20] For the designs that alleviate users' biases, what kind of information should be presented and how so that it might improve the users' decision-making? [5]_

### 3. **Question 2.3:** 
_Revisit the persona you created in Assignment 1. Discuss the consequences for the users (including how they would feel and act) if they adopt the product and make decisions. Then, stretch your imagination and discuss how it might impact the relationship between the persona and other stakeholders as the system becomes more integrated into their daily routine. [5]_
