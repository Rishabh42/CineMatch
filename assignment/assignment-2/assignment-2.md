# Assignment-2

## Task-1
### 1. **Question 1.1:** 
_Provide screenshots and explanations to illustrate how well each guideline is followed in the MS HAI [guilelines](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/01/Guidelines-for-Human-AI-Interaction-camera-ready.pdf). **If you cannot accurately evaluate some guideline(s), provide concrete reasons.** [12]_


### 2. **Question 1.2:** 
_Peform the same task with Q1.1 using the PAIR's [design patterns](https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/patterns). [12]_



### 3. **Question 1.3:** 
_Compare the report from the two works. Discuss how well they support the HAI design evaluation, including both their usefulness and limitations. [10] Explain how the design patterns help realize those design guidelines. Discuss if there is any aspect you find missing from either the guideline or design pattern to reveal the quality of the HAI design of the product. [10]_


## Task-2
### 1. **Question 2.1:** 
_Revisit the user stories you wrote in Assignment 1. Discuss what kind of decisions (big or small) its users need to make during interaction when trying to achieve their goals. Explain what the decision is, what knowledge is required to make the decision, and how much effort is needed to make such decisions. [10]_

### 2. **Question 2.2:** 
_Examine each decision-making point closely and consider if the users are vulnerable to any of the four biases from the work [Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1738360.pdf?casa_token=PEUwAsY9bNoAAAAA:i7KvVWYA73fJzugepP9xnVfBc_tCv1TWq884garHfyiwpR0kooepIGbSSfu__bxvaMYyMxTwGpCTCfzWrRXJI5-ghi44wtwX_WrGiSdQ2fKla6PhPH8), i.e., Representativeness, Availability, Adjustment and Anchoring. Explain how the design of the product exacerbates or alleviates each of the users' biases. [20] For the designs that alleviate users' biases, what kind of information should be presented and how so that it might improve the users' decision-making? [5]_

### 3. **Question 2.3:** 
_Revisit the persona you created in Assignment 1. Discuss the consequences for the users (including how they would feel and act) if they adopt the product and make decisions. Then, stretch your imagination and discuss how it might impact the relationship between the persona and other stakeholders as the system becomes more integrated into their daily routine. [5]_

**Maya:**

**Consequences for Maya:**

Maya might feel a sense of relief as routine tasks are streamlined, but she may also experience stress if the AI's output doesn't meet her standards or stifles her creativity.
she would lean on the AI for efficiency but may also carry out specific times to do work manually to ensure she maintains her critical thinking skills.

**Impact on Relationships:**

As Maya becomes more dependent on Notion AI, she could influence her peers to adopt similar tools, potentially changing the study groups from traditional discussions to more technology-driven ways.
Professors might question the depth of her understanding if her work appears lack of her voice, prompting Maya to balance AI use with her own inputs.

**Carl: **

**Consequences for Carl:**

Carl would appreciate the increased productivity within his team but might feel anxious about the team's over dependent on AI and potential loss of originality.
he would be proactive in ensuring that Notion AI is used as a supplement to the team’s work rather than a replacement, maintaining the creative process.

**Impact on Relationships:**

Team Dynamics could shift because members vary in their dependencies  on AI, with Carl taking a leadership role in guiding the responsible use of AI.

**Akira**
**Consequences for Akira:**

Akira may feel a combination of relief at the ease of managing administrative tasks and concern over privacy and originality.
he would likely become more insecure about data security and careful to ensure that AI-generated content doesn’t compromise the integrity of his research.

**Impact on Relationships:**

With His Research Team, Akira's approach to AI could lead to a team environment where there's a strong focus on attention to detail and using technology in a responsible and ethical way.
In the Academic Community, he could influence the conversation around AI, driving forward discussions on privacy, data security, and the role of AI in research.
### **Task3**: 
Presentation
