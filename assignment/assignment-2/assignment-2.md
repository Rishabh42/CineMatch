# Assignment-2

## Task-1
### 1. **Question 1.1:** 
_Provide screenshots and explanations to illustrate how well each guideline is followed in the MS HAI [guilelines](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/01/Guidelines-for-Human-AI-Interaction-camera-ready.pdf). **If you cannot accurately evaluate some guideline(s), provide concrete reasons.** [12]_


### 2. **Question 1.2:** 
_Peform the same task with Q1.1 using the PAIR's [design patterns](https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/patterns). [12]_


We went through the 23 design principles created by Google. Having summarized them, we checked how they are being adhered to by Notion AI. Following are our findings:

1.	**AI adds value:** Notion AI augments the capabilities of the user. It helps to speed up the workflow and helps in enhancing the creativity of the user. It can generate text responses based on user’s questions and the current page context. There is a distinct positive addition which it brings to the user’s work.

![pb-4](./artifacts/possibilities-4.PNG)


2. **Set the right expectations:** Notion AI is transparent about its capabilities and limitations. The company has cleary defined what the product [can do](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/using-notion-ai#:~:text=about%20artificial%20intelligence.-,What%20are%20the%20current%20functions%20of%20Notion%20AI%3F,-Use%20Notion%20AI) and what it [cannot do?](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/using-notion-ai#:~:text=product/ai.-,What%20are%20the%20current%20limitations%20of%20Notion%20AI%3F,-All%20AI%20outputs)

3. **Explain the benefit, not the technology:** Notion AI focuses on how it can help users be more efficient and creative, rather than explaining the underlying AI technology. Though they did provide a basic introduction to how they use AI to delivery the enhanced capabilities but that description is minimal in their docs. It is more about the [enhancements](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/notion-ai-for-docs) which the capability leads to instead of the technical background needed to create the same.

4. **Be accountable for errors:** Users have the final say on what to include in their docs. If they are not happy with what is generated by Notion AI, they can modify the text as they deem fit. Users also have access to the existing notion docs for [reference](https://www.notion.so/help/reference). We found that a lot of information regarding how the user can best utilise notion AI is present in the docs.

![action](./artifacts/meeting-action-items.PNG)

5. **Invest early in good data practices:** Notion AI strives to maintain good data quality and protection standards. As documented in their [privacy reference](https://www.notion.so/help/privacy) and [security practices](https://www.notion.so/security), notion AI has considered data security, privacy compliance programs (GDPR, SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA) and AI governance principles. They maintain an enterprise-grade infrastructure to ensure high reliability.

6. **Make precision and recall tradeoffs carefully:** Notion AI mainly generates translations and summaries. We determined that it priortizes recall over precision because the output is not generated keeping a conservative estimate in mind ensuring only true positives. As translations, summaries can be subjective by nature: Notion AI ends up generating more than just the essential results which is expected since brainstorming is much more effective in an unrestricted ideation environment. However, for summarization related tasks, it can be much more conservative. Users can modify the prompt to get the results they want.

![drafting-II](./artifacts/draft-2.PNG)


7. **Be transparent about privacy and data settings:** Notion AI is quite upfront about their privacy and data handling practices. They have defined the following in an easily accessible manner:
- [List of subprocessors](https://www.notion.so/Notion-s-List-of-Subprocessors-268fa5bcfa0f46b6bc29436b21676734)
- [Privacy practices](https://www.notion.so/help/privacy): Who owns the the data? Who handles it? Who controls it? Data backup and deletion practices
- [Security practices](https://www.notion.so/help/security-and-privacy): Data and application security profile, Access Control, Infrastructure, Endpoint Security, Network Security
- They support the following [product security features](https://www.notion.so/help/security-and-privacy#product-security-features):
  - Domain Management
  - SAML Single Sign-On (SSO)
  - SCIM Provisioning and Revoking
  - Audit Log
  - 2FA (MFA)
  - Permission and Team spaces management

8. **Make it safe to explore:** There is no kill switches in the notion AI through which user may unintentionally cause irreversible damage. Users have the capability to revert their actions and until user accepts the suggestion given by Notion AI, it is not applied to their document which makes it very user-friendly in terms of exploration from a user's perspective.
![user-acceptance](./artifacts/user-acceptance.PNG)
![user-acceptance-2](./artifacts/user-acceptance-2.PNG)

9.  **Anchor on familiarity:** Notion has maintained the existing UI they had for note-taking before introduction of Notion AI in the system. This means that AI features are packaged as a add-on to the main product which is notion rather than shifting the limelight from note taking to generative AI in the app which would have detracted users from the initial goal and familiarity of the notion system.

![actions-II](./artifacts/AI-actions.PNG)

10. **Add context from human sources:** Notion AI uses user’s questions and the current page context to generate text responses. Users have full control on how the generated output is used. Since the interface for notion AI is designed in a manner similar to chatGPT, thus it will be simple for users to tailor the responses to their requirements by giving the right prompt to the system.

![feedback](./artifacts/feedback.PNG)

11. **Determine how to show model confidence, if at all:** Notion AI does not explicitly mention how it shows model confidence. We did not find evidence of different UIs being tried out in Notion AI before they arrived at the current one. Maybe, they will have such iterations in the future but we did observe that they are adding new capabilites to the system even in the span of 3 months. There is a new feature incoming which can serve as a QnA system for the notes created within the workspace. It will be quite useful for organisation level workspaces. [(source)](https://www.notion.so/blog/introducing-q-and-a)

12. **Explain for understanding, not completeness:** Notion AI provides the users with the information based on the prompt they have given and the text they have selected for generating the response. The context for the response can include both: i) the data within Notion, ii) the data from external sources using which chatGPT3.5 was trained. We did not find evidence of:
- model confidence displays
- partial explanations
- We did observe that if the user provides more prompts, the responses can get more detailed. Also, the user has the ability to set the length of the response which he/she is expecting based on the prompt.

13.  **Go beyond in-the-moment explanations:** Since Notion AI has the ability to access external information apart from the data contained in Notion, it is capable of and does provide explanation of concepts mentioned in the prompt and the selected text even though the context for them may not be present in the Notion database.

14. **Automate more when risk is low:** When the user is in brainstorming mode, then the outputs being generated are more varied and can have tangential viewpoints than what was mentioned in the prompts but when the user is trying to summarize the documents, the outputs are much more restricted.

15. **Let users give feedback:** Users can give feedback to the system. They can text with Notion AI using the chat-like interface or they can upvote/ dislike the response they received for their prompt.

16. **Let users supervise automation:** Users can select if they want to include the generated content in their notes or not. They can also select differnet types of tasks for which the response is to be generated. It influences the writing style but the users do not have any option to control the response while it is being generated.

17. **Automate in phases:** Though, Notion AI does not explicitly mention how it automates in phases but it does provide users the choice to adjust how they want to generate content. Users can choose the length of the content being generated depending on the task they are generating it for. There are options available to users to progressively increase the offloading of tasks to Notion AI.

18. **Give control back to the user when automation fails:** Notion AI does not take the control from the user because the final say on whether to include the generated content in the notes rests with the users itself. If the user is not satisfied with what they get as response, they can not include it in their write-up.

19. **Design for your data labelers:** Notion AI does not explicitly mention how it designs for data labelers. They mention that they maintain a list of [subprocessors](https://www.notion.so/Notion-s-List-of-Subprocessors-268fa5bcfa0f46b6bc29436b21676734) but each subprocessor may have a different retention policy to help them meet the customer obligations. We did not find which subprocessor is responsible for data labelling but we found that Anthropic OpenAI, Qwak are responsible for hosting large language models and embeddings.

20. **Actively maintain your dataset:** Notion AI does not explicitly mention how it maintains its dataset. When a specific query is executed for the selected block of user data, then it ingests the data for generating results. Though, officially they mention that data backed up in notes will not be used for training models for Notion AI but since it is a closed source product and there is no direct access to the backend AI API which notion uses, so we cannot comment how they maintain the dataset.

21. **Learn from label disagreements:** Since the underlying implementation supporting AI backend is abtracted, we cannot comment on how Notion AI learns from label disagreements.

22. **Embrace “noisy” data:** Notion AI does not explicitly mention how it embraces noisy data but we do think that the product is quite robust to different kinds of user inputs. Since the underlying implementation supporting AI backend is abtracted, we cannot comment on how noisy data has been embraced by notion AI.

23. **Get input from domain experts as you build your dataset:** Notion AI does not explicitly mention how it gets input from domain experts. They do use the chatGPT 3.5 version API to serve responses but they do not go into explicit details for the same. So, we cannot comment on how exactly the dataset was built and if inputs from domain experts was used.



### 3. **Question 1.3:** 
We observed that the Microsoft guidelines touch more on the user experience of the human-AI interaction, for example, G7 (Support efcient invocation), G12 (Remember recent interactions), and on the topic of AI ethics and principles, for example, G5 (Match relevant social norms) and G6 (Mitigate social biases).

On the other hand, the PAIR design patterns cover a broader spectrum of concerns, focusing on the architectural and developer-oriented considerations for human-AI design. For example, PAIR incorporates guidelines related to privacy and data settings, which is not covered by the Microsoft guidelines. It also covers topics like automation (automate more when risk is low, automate in phases) and inputs from domain experts. PAIR also promotes design considerations related to discrepancy handling, like label disagreements and noisy data. PAIR also tends to be more specific, providing examples and specific suggestions. 

#### Usefulness
Both Microsoft guidelines and PAIR design patterns offer valuable considerations when designing and evaluating AI products. The following are some useful aspects common to both works: 
- **Transparency**: Both works promote transparency in design, encouraging the design to plainly acknowledge limitations and potential inaccuracies. (G2: Make clear how well the system can do what it can
do and DP2: Set the right expectations). In our case, it helps users of Notion AI to understand that they should not hold the generated content as the final authority, which can be important when the stakes of having accurate information is high.
- **Incorporate user feedback**: Both works encourage allowing users to provide feedback about their interaction with the AI system, which is essential to for the continuous improvement of the product.
- **Giving users control over poor or incorrect predictions**: Both works highlight what to do when the AI product fails to deliver as expected or as the user desires. Having an easy and effective way to dismiss undesired outputs is an essential part of a good user experience. For example, if Notion AI replaced the user's content with its generated content without approval, it would not benefit the user in case of a poor prediction.

##### Microsoft guidelines
The Microsoft guidelines are useful to assess the ease of use of the AI system. It focuses on the user experience of the AI interaction, emphasizing the importance of clearly conveying the capabilities and limitations of the system, and ensuring that users can easily access the AI services and efficiently make decisions about the AI system's output. Another important aspect it touches upon is notifying users about changes in the AI system, which is especially useful in a rapidly evolving field. 

##### PAIR design patterns
The PAIR design patterns are useful to evaluate whether best practices are followed in implementation and to encourage develop to think about various architectural considerations while implementing the AI system. As AI systems deal with large amounts of data, privacy of the data is an important issue, which PAIR touches upon. PAIR also provides useful guidance on data labeling and dataset management. In addition, PAIR encourages gradual automation to adapt to the user's preferences.

#### Limitations
We found that the Microsoft guidelines and the Google design patterns do not account for all the cases in which AI can be used in different systems. Since, we are still exploring different usecases in which AI can be incorporated in our existing system, there is a lot of scope to establish new usage patterns. Now, what this means for the guidelines and design patterns is that they need to predict the potential problems which may arise in so far unseen usecases and account for them. This is not a trivial task because most of the AI enabled applications are targetted to large scale user base (social media, etc) with a goal of providing personalised experience to all the users. This leaves a lot of room for fairness and privacy issues. 

These guidelines are limited in their coverage of fairness problems in AI systems. Google design patterns adopt more of a developer perspective and do not go into details of system bias and impartiality of the results while Microsoft guidelines do not explore the responsible usage of AI in a greater detail. They have bunched together all the ethical and impartiality issues due to the introduction of AI enabled systems under (matching of social norms) Guideline 5 and (mitigating social biases) Guideline 6. In the current state of AI/ML, there still exist non-deterministic aspects in our models where we cannot map each individual input to each output distinctly. There is a lot of work to be done in explaining why a particular AI system believes in a particular output. What these guidelines have done so far is to provide some structure in developing applications with the introduction of this non-deterministic abstraction in our otherwise deterministic software engineering practices but what is still missing from these guidelines is the careful evaluation and monitoring of AI enabled systems on people as a whole and society in general beyond the scope of just what the system is intending to cover in its domain.


#### Missing from the guidelines or design pattern for quality evaluation of the HAI design of the product
The biggest missing factor in both the guidelines and the design patterns is the lack of measurable metrics/ a method to make sure that the AI system is alignign well with them. In their current form, it is up to willingness of system designers and developers, that how far are they willing to go and how much efforts are the willing to put in understanding the implications of their AI enabled system not just across the domain in which their product is going to work in, but also related areas where there can be spillover effects. With the added pressure of real world deadlines and costs involved in development, the designers/ developers may not want to digress from their technical work in order to make their system more aligned with the guidelines/ patterns. The problem is there is no real way of distinguishing how well aligned a system is to the guidelines/ patterns or if adopting a different design strateg positively/ negatively affects the alignment of the product with the guidelines/ strategies. Currently, it is upto the discretion of the designers and developers which is quite open-ended and abstract.

To explain further, consider PEP 8 standards for python coding. These stylistic conventions were made to introduce a certain level clarity and standardisation in the code people write and there are various extensions available in different editors which can highlight the specific PEP warnings. It is also an integral part of code quality checking by providing metrics and warnings. Often these quality checking packages assign a score to the code file. Developers can relate the changes they make to the warnings they see and can eventually observe the changes in the score along with it.

So a similar system of measurement is needed for AI enabled systems as well to ensure greater accountability by system designers and adherence to the guidelines/ patterns established. We need to develop wrappers based on these guidelines considering the evolving usecases for AI and relate them to universally standardised metrics so that people can compare on a common ground and remove the abstraction based on individual's discretion.

## Task-2

### 2. **Question 2.2:** 
_Examine each decision-making point closely and consider if the users are vulnerable to any of the four biases from the work [Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1738360.pdf?casa_token=PEUwAsY9bNoAAAAA:i7KvVWYA73fJzugepP9xnVfBc_tCv1TWq884garHfyiwpR0kooepIGbSSfu__bxvaMYyMxTwGpCTCfzWrRXJI5-ghi44wtwX_WrGiSdQ2fKla6PhPH8), i.e., Representativeness, Availability, Adjustment and Anchoring. Explain how the design of the product exacerbates or alleviates each of the users' biases. [20] For the designs that alleviate users' biases, what kind of information should be presented and how so that it might improve the users' decision-making? [5]_

**Examine each decision-making point closely and consider if the users are vulnerable to any of the four biases. Explain how the design of the product exacerbates or alleviates each of the users' biases.**

- Decision: Accept or correct the spelling or grammatical suggestions.
  - **Bias: Availability**: There will likely be no doubt with regard to spelling mistakes as Notion AI can accurately correct spelling mistakes. However, for grammatical corrections, the user could be subject to availability bias if they want to judge the accuracy of the correction. They may need to rely on their memory of grammatical rules to evaluate the corrections. 
  - *How the design exacerbates the bias*: Notion AI does not highlight the changes made, but simply outputs the corrected text. This may make it slightly harder to identify the corrected text and check its accuracy. 

- Decision: Determining which notes to give to the AI to generate the todo list
  - **Availability**: This decision again could be influenced by availability bias. Users may be more likely to select notes that contain information readily available to them, neglecting less accessible notes. This could cause the to-do list to miss out some important tasks that were note covered by the notes.
  - *How the design alleviates the bias*: Notion AI allows you to select particular text blocks to perform an AI operation on. This allows the user to select only what they wish to give. Notion also provides templates to organize meeting notes systematically which can facilitate the user's task of choosing relevant notes. 

- Decision: Review the generated todo list and determine which ones are relevant to his/her needs.
  - **Availability**: To determine which tasks are relevant to his/her needs, the user needs to make this judgement based on what they recall best from the meeting discussion or their notes.  
  - *How the design alleviates the bias*: As described in the previous notes, Notion helps to organize one's notes which can help the user verify the generated content more easily by quickly referring to these notes.

- Decision: Creating the prompt to ask for information on a particular event.
  - **Representativeness**: The way the prompt is framed may be influenced by the user's preconceived notions about the event which may in turn skew the generated content.
  - *How the design alleviates the bias*: Notion AI does not reinforce any preconceived notions the user may have as it does not autocomplete a user's prompt, allowing them to represent their thought fully.

- Decision: Determining which meeting notes to give to the AI to generate the meeting minute.
  - **Availability**: It is more likely that the user will provide the AI with the parts of the meeting notes that he has understood the best, possibly the parts he has written. If other meeting members have added notes that the user has not really taken the time to understand, it is less likely that he will give them to the AI to create the meeting minutes. This is an availability bias.
  - *How the design alleviate the bias*: Given that in the collaborative mode of Notion, everyone can write and read all created files, other team members can review the generated meeting minutes and check if any parts are missing. Notion also provides templates to organize meeting notes systematically which can facilitate the user's task of choosing relevant notes.

- Decision: Choose the information that should appear in the meeting minute / the structure of the meeting minute (in the case where the user gives more information to the AI to generate the meeting minute)
  - **Availability**: It is more likely that the user will generate meeting minutes similar to what he is accustomed to using in his meetings, even if it is less relevant for these particular meeting minutes.
  - **Enchor**: The first template that is presented to the user is more likely to be chosen.
  - **How the design alleviate the biases**: Notion provides templates to organize meeting notes systematically which can facilitate the user's task of choosing relevant notes.

- Decision: Determining which old meeting minutes to give to the AI to generate the meeting agenda.
  - **Availability**: It is more likely that the user will provide the meeting minutes that he is familiar with.
  - **How the design alleviate the biases**: The readability of meeting minutes created by Notion's AI allows the user to quickly understand the older meeting minutes with which he is not familiar.

- Decision: Review the generate meeting agenda and determine which parts are relevant to the meeting.
  - **Representativeness**: It is possible that the user makes this decision based on what he believes is a good meeting agenda, relying on his own understanding of the representation of a meeting agenda.
  - **How the design alleviate the biases**: The agenda ideas generated by Notion's AI can give the user new ideas for filling in the meeting agenda. The separation into blocks allows the user to easily delete or keep only small parts.

- Decision: Removing irrelevant dates adding to the calendar by the AI.
  - **Representativeness**: The user often has a preconceived idea of what a relevant date may be and will apply their own representation of this idea when selecting dates.
  - **How the design alleviate the biases**: The dates generated by Notion's AI can give the user new ideas for planning his/her life.

- Decision: Determine the length of the summary and/or how detailed the summary is.
  - **Anchor and adaptation**: It's likely that the user will initially use the default settings and never change them because he/she will be used to this length of summary and this amount of details.
  - **How the design exacerbates the bias**: Notion gives default settings.

- Decision: Determine if he or she would like more information on a part of the paper after reading the first summary. (for example regenerate a summary for a particular part, or asking for more precision)
  - **Availability**: It's likely that if the user is more familiar with a concept in the paper, it's more probable that this concept will catch their attention, and they would want more details on it than if the concept is new to them and they only have a brief overview. If the summary of the new concept doesn't explain why it's important/useful or doesn't clarify the concept well, the user may not seek further information.
  - **How the design exacerbates the bias**: Notion's AI uses GPT-3.5, which can sometimes explain a concept poorly when summarizing it.

- Decision: Assessing the privacy implications of using the Notion AI knowing the Notion's Privacy Policy.
  - **Anchor**: The user will probably read Notion's privacy policy only once, and even if it changes, they may not necessarily alter their perception of Notion's privacy policy.
  - **How the design alleviate the biases**: Notion notifies users when they change their privacy policy.

- Decision: Choosing when to use language translation.
  - **Representativeness**: It's likely that the user has a preconceived idea of what should be translated or not (e.g., proper nouns), so the user will use translation only when they believe it aligns with their idea of what should be translated.
  - **How the design alleviate the biases**: Notion mainly allows for the translation of entire texts rather than word-for-word, which reduces this bias as there are fewer choices to make, thus less freedom in the selection.

- Decision: Choosing to accept the translation or not.
  - **Availability**: If the user does not understand the proposed translation, it's likely that they will be less inclined to choose it compared to a situation where they understand the suggested translation.
  - **How the design exacerbates the bias**: Notion allows to regenerate a translation for a given text if the first translation does not suit us.



- Decision: Selecting sentences for improvement.

- Decision: Adding a reference.

- Decision: Choosing the category of the references.

- Decision: Choosing which features are essential for free use. (for example in the case where notion leaves the possibility of choosing a limited number of features for free)

- Decision: Creating the prompt to generate the list of ideas.

**For the designs that alleviate users' biases, what kind of information should be presented and how so that it might improve the users' decision-making?**
- Include information about the decisions here...
- What kind of information to present?
  The user should be able to able to view the complete picture of both sides of the decision he/she is about to make. The UI should display to the user what the intermediate output of choosing a particular type of option would be and it should be reversible. This will allow the user to make up he/her own mind after seeing the output for each perspective. It is possible that intelligent systems may permeate biases based on the output being generated for the user but even if the outout may not be balanced which may not be practical in all circumstances, atleast having outputs from each perspective can be quite helpful for the user.
- How should the information be presented? 
  For Notion AI, such a information can be presented in the form of displaying intermediate outputs on the screen while giving the option to the user to pick one. It would be wrong to influence the user in the name of eliminating bias by pushing a particular view more than the other. The right approach should be to present both perspectives to the user and it should be the user who makes the decision. Because the content part of a User's notion workspace is considered to be written by User and a representative of his/her viewpoints. Lastly, as an enhancement, there can be a adjustable toggle for deciding the parameters of the model to generate the response. Currently, the app has different menu options to select the type of response expected to be generated by Notion AI but it can be further customised by toggling individual styles and emotions in the response. The GUI can look quite similar to how it looks in games where such graphics are used to customize character parameters.
### 3. **Question 2.3:** 
_Revisit the persona you created in Assignment 1. Discuss the consequences for the users (including how they would feel and act) if they adopt the product and make decisions. Then, stretch your imagination and discuss how it might impact the relationship between the persona and other stakeholders as the system becomes more integrated into their daily routine. [5]_

**Maya:**

**Consequences for Maya:**

Maya might feel a sense of relief as routine tasks are streamlined, but she may also experience stress if the AI's output doesn't meet her standards or stifles her creativity.
she would lean on the AI for efficiency but may also carry out specific times to do work manually to ensure she maintains her critical thinking skills.

**Impact on Relationships:**

As Maya becomes more dependent on Notion AI, she could influence her peers to adopt similar tools, potentially changing the study groups from traditional discussions to more technology-driven ways.
Professors might question the depth of her understanding if her work appears lack of her voice, prompting Maya to balance AI use with her own inputs.

**Carl:**

**Consequences for Carl:**

Carl would appreciate the increased productivity within his team but might feel anxious about the team's over dependent on AI and potential loss of originality.
he would be proactive in ensuring that Notion AI is used as a supplement to the team’s work rather than a replacement, maintaining the creative process.

**Impact on Relationships:**

Team Dynamics could shift because members vary in their dependencies  on AI, with Carl taking a leadership role in guiding the responsible use of AI.

**Akira:**

**Consequences for Akira:**

Akira may feel a combination of relief at the ease of managing administrative tasks and concern over privacy and originality.
he would likely become more insecure about data security and careful to ensure that AI-generated content doesn’t compromise the integrity of his research.

**Impact on Relationships:**

With His Research Team, Akira's approach to AI could lead to a team environment where there's a strong focus on attention to detail and using technology in a responsible and ethical way.
In the Academic Community, he could influence the conversation around AI, driving forward discussions on privacy, data security, and the role of AI in research.
