# Assignment-2

## Task-1
### 1. **Question 1.1:** 
_Provide screenshots and explanations to illustrate how well each guideline is followed in the MS HAI [guilelines](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/01/Guidelines-for-Human-AI-Interaction-camera-ready.pdf). **If you cannot accurately evaluate some guideline(s), provide concrete reasons.** [12]_


### 2. **Question 1.2:** 
_Peform the same task with Q1.1 using the PAIR's [design patterns](https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/patterns). [12]_


We went through 23 design principles created by Google. Having summarized them, we checked how they are being adhered to by Notion AI. Following are our findings:

1.	**AI adds value:** Notion AI augments the capabilities of the user. It helps to speed up the workflow and helps in enhancing the creativity of the user. It can generate text responses based on user’s questions and the current page context. There is a distinct positive addition which it brings to the user’s work.

![action](./artifacts/meeting-action-items.PNG)

2. **Set the right expectations:** Notion AI is transparent about its capabilities and limitations. The company has cleary defined what the product [can do](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/using-notion-ai#:~:text=about%20artificial%20intelligence.-,What%20are%20the%20current%20functions%20of%20Notion%20AI%3F,-Use%20Notion%20AI) and what it [cannot do?](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/using-notion-ai#:~:text=product/ai.-,What%20are%20the%20current%20limitations%20of%20Notion%20AI%3F,-All%20AI%20outputs)

3. **Explain the benefit, not the technology:** Notion AI focuses on how it can help users be more efficient and creative, rather than explaining the underlying AI technology. Though they did provide a basic introduction to how they use AI to delivery the enhanced capabilities but that description is minimal in their docs. It is more about the [enhancements](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/notion-ai-for-docs) which the capability leads to instead of the technical background needed to create the same.

4. **Be accountable for errors:** Users have the final say on what to include in their docs. If they are not happy with what is generated by Notion AI, they can modify the text as they deem fit. Users also have access to the existing notion docs for [reference](https://www.notion.so/help/reference). We found that a lot of information regarding how the user can best utilise notion AI is present in the docs. 

5. **Invest early in good data practices:** Notion AI strives to maintain good data quality and protection standards. As documented in their [privacy reference](https://www.notion.so/help/privacy) and [security practices](https://www.notion.so/security), notion AI has considered data security, privacy compliance programs (GDPR, SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA) and AI governance principles. They maintain an enterprise-grade infrastructure to ensure high reliability.

6. **Make precision and recall tradeoffs carefully:** Notion AI mainly generates translations and summaries. We determined that it priortizes recall over precision because the output is not generated keeping a conservative estimate in mind ensuring only true positives. As translations, summaries can be subjective by nature: Notion AI ends up generating more than just the essential results which is expected since brainstorming is much more effective in an unrestricted ideation environment. However, for summarization related tasks, it can be much more conservative. Users can modify the prompt to get the results they want.

7. **Be transparent about privacy and data settings:** Notion AI is quite upfront about their privacy and data handling practices. They have defined the following in an easily accessible manner:
- [List of subprocessors](https://www.notion.so/Notion-s-List-of-Subprocessors-268fa5bcfa0f46b6bc29436b21676734)
- [Privacy practices](https://www.notion.so/help/privacy): Who owns the the data? Who handles it? Who controls it? Data backup and deletion practices
- [Security practices](https://www.notion.so/help/security-and-privacy): Data and application security profile, Access Control, Infrastructure, Endpoint Security, Network Security
- They support the following [product security features](https://www.notion.so/help/security-and-privacy#product-security-features):
  - Domain Management
  - SAML Single Sign-On (SSO)
  - SCIM Provisioning and Revoking
  - Audit Log
  - 2FA (MFA)
  - Permission and Team spaces management

8. **Make it safe to explore:** There is no kill switches in the notion AI through which user may unintentionally cause irreversible damage. Users have the capability to revert their actions and until user accepts the suggestion given by Notion AI, it is not applied to their document which makes it very user-friendly in terms of exploration from a user's perspective.

![user-acceptance-2](./artifacts/user-acceptance-2.PNG)

9.  **Anchor on familiarity:** Notion has maintained the existing UI they had for note-taking before introduction of Notion AI in the system. This means that AI features are packaged as a add-on to the main product which is notion rather than shifting the limelight from note taking to generative AI in the app which would have detracted users from the initial goal and familiarity of the notion system.

![actions-II](./artifacts/AI-actions.PNG)

10. **Add context from human sources:** Notion AI uses user’s questions and the current page context to generate text responses. Users have full control on how the generated output is used. Since the interface for notion AI is designed in a manner similar to chatGPT, thus it will be simple for users to tailor the responses to their requirements by giving the right prompt to the system.

![pb-4](./artifacts/possibilities-4.PNG)

11. **Determine how to show model confidence, if at all:** Notion AI does not explicitly mention how it shows model confidence. We did not find evidence of different UIs being tried out in Notion AI before they arrived at the current one. Maybe, they will have such iterations in the future but we did observe that they are adding new capabilites to the system even in the span of 3 months. There is a new feature incoming which can serve as a QnA system for the notes created within the workspace. It will be quite useful for organisation level workspaces. [(source)](https://www.notion.so/blog/introducing-q-and-a)

12. **Explain for understanding, not completeness:** Notion AI provides the users with the information based on the prompt they have given and the text they have selected for generating the response. The context for the response can include both: i) the data within Notion, ii) the data from external sources using which chatGPT3.5 was trained. We did not find evidence of:
- model confidence displays
- partial explanations
- We did observe that if the user provides more prompts, the responses can get more detailed. Also, the user has the ability to set the length of the response which he/she is expecting based on the prompt.

13.  **Go beyond in-the-moment explanations:** Since Notion AI has the ability to access external information apart from the data contained in Notion, it is capable of and does provide explanation of concepts mentioned in the prompt and the selected text even though the context for them may not be present in the Notion database.

14. **Automate more when risk is low:** When the user is in brainstorming mode, then the outputs being generated are more varied and can have tangential viewpoints than what was mentioned in the prompts but when the user is trying to summarize the documents, the outputs are much more restricted.

15. **Let users give feedback:** Users can give feedback to the system. They can text with Notion AI using the chat-like interface or they can upvote/ dislike the response they received for their prompt.

16. **Let users supervise automation:** Users can select if they want to include the generated content in their notes or not. They can also select differnet types of tasks for which the response is to be generated. It influences the writing style but the users do not have any option to control the response while it is being generated.

17. **Automate in phases:** Though, Notion AI does not explicitly mention how it automates in phases but it does provide users the choice to adjust how they want to generate content. Users can choose the length of the content being generated depending on the task they are generating it for. There are options available to users to progressively increase the offloading of tasks to Notion AI.

18. **Give control back to the user when automation fails:** Notion AI does not take the control from the user because the final say on whether to include the generated content in the notes rests with the users itself. If the user is not satisfied with what they get as response, they can not include it in their write-up.

19. **Design for your data labelers:** Notion AI does not explicitly mention how it designs for data labelers. They mention that they maintain a list of [subprocessors](https://www.notion.so/Notion-s-List-of-Subprocessors-268fa5bcfa0f46b6bc29436b21676734) but each subprocessor may have a different retention policy to help them meet the customer obligations. We did not find which subprocessor is responsible for data labelling but we found that Anthropic OpenAI, Qwak are responsible for hosting large language models and embeddings.

20. **Actively maintain your dataset:** Notion AI does not explicitly mention how it maintains its dataset. When a specific query is executed for the selected block of user data, then it ingests the data for generating results. Though, officially they mention that data backed up in notes will not be used for training models for Notion AI but since it is a closed source product and there is no direct access to the backend AI API which notion uses, so we cannot comment how they maintain the dataset.

21. **Learn from label disagreements:** Since the underlying implementation supporting AI backend is abtracted, we cannot comment on how Notion AI learns from label disagreements.

22. **Embrace “noisy” data:** Notion AI does not explicitly mention how it embraces noisy data but we do think that the product is quite robust to different kinds of user inputs. Since the underlying implementation supporting AI backend is abtracted, we cannot comment on how noisy data has been embraced by notion AI.

23. **Get input from domain experts as you build your dataset:** Notion AI does not explicitly mention how it gets input from domain experts. They do use the chatGPT 3.5 version API to serve responses but they do not go into explicit details for the same. So, we cannot comment on how exactly the dataset was built and if inputs from domain experts was used.




### 3. **Question 1.3:** 
_Compare the report from the two works. Discuss how well they support the HAI design evaluation, including both their usefulness and limitations. [10] Explain how the design patterns help realize those design guidelines. Discuss if there is any aspect you find missing from either the guideline or design pattern to reveal the quality of the HAI design of the product. [10]_


## Task-2
### 1. **Question 2.1:** 
_Revisit the user stories you wrote in Assignment 1. Discuss what kind of decisions (big or small) its users need to make during interaction when trying to achieve their goals. Explain what the decision is, what knowledge is required to make the decision, and how much effort is needed to make such decisions. [10]_

1) **User story:** As a student, I want to have indications when I did spelling or c mistakes in a text so that I can be sure that I submit a report without grammatical or spelling errors. 
	- **Decision:** Accept or correct the spelling or grammatical suggestions.
		- **Knowledge:** Understanding of correct spelling and grammar.
	  - **Effort:** Low effort: the student only have to review and accept or reject the suggestions.

2) **User story:** As a student, I want to generate todo list from notes so that I can clearly know what I need to do next and keep track of my progress without wasting the time to transform my notes into a todo list by myself.
	- **Decision:** Determining which notes to give to the AI to generate the todo list.
	  - **Knowledge:** Familiarity with the notes and prioritization.
	  - **Effort:** Moderate effort: the student must actively think about which note to include.
    - **Decision:** Review the generate todo list and determine which ones are relevant to his/her needs.
      - **Knowledge:** Knowing his/her need and what can be relevent to him/her, knowing the notes.
      - **Effort:** Low effort: the student only have to review and keep or remove the todos.

3) **User story:** As a student, I want to generate content on events that are happening now or on recent works so that I can have up-to-date information when I study recent works or events. 
    - **Decision:** Creating the prompt to ask for information on a particular event.
      - **Knowledge:** Understanding of how to write a prompt.
      - **Effort:** Moderate effort: the student have to actively think about how to write the prompt.

4) As a student, I want to generate key ideas from notes I wrote so that I can save time when I just want to remember the principal ideas of my lecture notes. 
    - **Decision:** Determining which notes to give to the AI to generate the key ideas.
      - **Knowledge:** Familiarity with the notes.
      - **Effort:** Low effort: most of the time, the student will just give the entire messy notes without reviewing them a lot.
   
5) As a team collaborator, I want to quickly summarize and structure messy meeting notes into a clear meeting minute so that I can save time and send to my collaborators clear and structured meeting minutes. 
    - **Decision:** Determining which meeting notes to give to the AI to generate the meeting minute.
      - **Knowledge:** Understanding of meeting context and familiarity with the notes.
      - **Effort:** Low to moderate effort: the effort will depend on how efficient the AI is, and whether the notes can be given almost entirely to generate an understandable and relevant meeting minute.
    - **Decision:** choose the information that should appear in the meeting minute / the structure of the meeting minute (in the case where the user gives more information to the AI to generate the meeting minute)
      - **Knowledge:** Understanding of meeting context and familiarity with the notes.
      - **Effort:** Moderate effort: the collaborator have to actively think about the structure of the meeting minute.
   
6) As a team collaborator, I want to generate a meeting agenda based on notes or old meeting minutes so that we can know exactly what we should discuss in meetings. 
    - **Decision:** Determining which old meeting minutes to give to the AI to generate the meeting agenda.
	    - **Knowledge:** Familiarity with the old meeting minutes.
	    - **Effort:** Moderate effort: the collaborator must actively think about which mitunes are relevant to generate the meeting agenda.
    - **Decision:** Review the generate meeting agenda and determine which parts are relevant to the meeting.
      - **Knowledge:** Understanding of meeting context.
      - **Effort:** Moderate effort: maybe the collaborator have to correct some of the generate part of the meeting agenda.
   
7) As a team collaborator, I want the AI to automatically add into my calendar the next meetings or deadlines that we discussed in our meeting notes so that I'm sure I won't miss any appointments or deadlines. 
   
8) As a researcher I want to generate a summary for a research paper so that I can easily know what the paper is about and what are the key ideas of the paper. 
   
9) As a researcher I want to know how Notion uses my data when I use their AI so that I can know if I can use AI to work on sensitive content that requires privacy. 
   
10) As a researcher and a non-native English speaker, I want to easily translate what I write so that I can get help writing my papers in English when I don't know the translation of a word. 

11) As a researcher and a non-native English speaker, I want the AI to reformulate and improve what I wrote so that my papers seem to be written by a native English speaker. 

12) As a researcher I want to quickly structure all the references I keep track of so that I can quickly find a reference that I am looking for. 

13) As a researcher who work in a lab with not much fundings, I want to have access to some Notion AI features for free so that I can be more productive in my research and participate in the common good without spending money. 

14) As an academic member, I want to generate a list of ideas on a specific subject so that I can quickly collect ideas that I can develop for a project or a work.

### 2. **Question 2.2:** 
_Examine each decision-making point closely and consider if the users are vulnerable to any of the four biases from the work [Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1738360.pdf?casa_token=PEUwAsY9bNoAAAAA:i7KvVWYA73fJzugepP9xnVfBc_tCv1TWq884garHfyiwpR0kooepIGbSSfu__bxvaMYyMxTwGpCTCfzWrRXJI5-ghi44wtwX_WrGiSdQ2fKla6PhPH8), i.e., Representativeness, Availability, Adjustment and Anchoring. Explain how the design of the product exacerbates or alleviates each of the users' biases. [20] For the designs that alleviate users' biases, what kind of information should be presented and how so that it might improve the users' decision-making? [5]_

**For the designs that alleviate users' biases, what kind of information should be presented and how so that it might improve the users' decision-making?**
- Include information about the decisions here...
- What kind of information to present?
  The user should be able to able to view the complete picture of both sides of the decision he/she is about to make. The UI should display to the user what the intermediate output of choosing a particular type of option would be and it should be reversible. This will allow the user to make up he/her own mind after seeing the output for each perspective. It is possible that intelligent systems may permeate biases based on the output being generated for the user but even if the outout may not be balanced which may not be practical in all circumstances, atleast having outputs from each perspective can be quite helpful for the user.
- How should the information be presented? 
  For Notion AI, such a information can be presented in the form of displaying intermediate outputs on the screen while giving the option to the user to pick one. It would be wrong to influence the user in the name of eliminating bias by pushing a particular view more than the other. The right approach should be to present both perspectives to the user and it should be the user who makes the decision. Because the content part of a User's notion workspace is considered to be written by User and a representative of his/her viewpoints. Lastly, as an enhancement, there can be a adjustable toggle for deciding the parameters of the model to generate the response. Currently, the app has different menu options to select the type of response expected to be generated by Notion AI but it can be further customised by toggling individual styles and emotions in the response. The GUI can look quite similar to how it looks in games where such graphics are used to customize character parameters.
### 3. **Question 2.3:** 
_Revisit the persona you created in Assignment 1. Discuss the consequences for the users (including how they would feel and act) if they adopt the product and make decisions. Then, stretch your imagination and discuss how it might impact the relationship between the persona and other stakeholders as the system becomes more integrated into their daily routine. [5]_

**Maya:**

**Consequences for Maya:**

Maya might feel a sense of relief as routine tasks are streamlined, but she may also experience stress if the AI's output doesn't meet her standards or stifles her creativity.
she would lean on the AI for efficiency but may also carry out specific times to do work manually to ensure she maintains her critical thinking skills.

**Impact on Relationships:**

As Maya becomes more dependent on Notion AI, she could influence her peers to adopt similar tools, potentially changing the study groups from traditional discussions to more technology-driven ways.
Professors might question the depth of her understanding if her work appears lack of her voice, prompting Maya to balance AI use with her own inputs.

**Carl:**

**Consequences for Carl:**

Carl would appreciate the increased productivity within his team but might feel anxious about the team's over dependent on AI and potential loss of originality.
he would be proactive in ensuring that Notion AI is used as a supplement to the team’s work rather than a replacement, maintaining the creative process.

**Impact on Relationships:**

Team Dynamics could shift because members vary in their dependencies  on AI, with Carl taking a leadership role in guiding the responsible use of AI.

**Akira:**

**Consequences for Akira:**

Akira may feel a combination of relief at the ease of managing administrative tasks and concern over privacy and originality.
he would likely become more insecure about data security and careful to ensure that AI-generated content doesn’t compromise the integrity of his research.

**Impact on Relationships:**

With His Research Team, Akira's approach to AI could lead to a team environment where there's a strong focus on attention to detail and using technology in a responsible and ethical way.
In the Academic Community, he could influence the conversation around AI, driving forward discussions on privacy, data security, and the role of AI in research.
### **Task3**: 
Presentation
