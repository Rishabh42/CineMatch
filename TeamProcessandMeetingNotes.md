******Team Process and Meeting Notes******

**Team Organization**:
Our team was organized with an intention to contribute activly and equally. We set up the roles in our workflow (A0) and  assigned the team members based on individual strengths and experience, ranging from data engineering, backend development to machine learning. This effective categorization in roles helped us to better collaborate and ensuring project completion.

**Communication Channel**s:
Our team mostly used Slack and WhatsApp for day-to-day communication and updates. two weekly meetings were scheduled after classes, with both in-person and virtual Zoom sessions. To maintain documentation, GitLab was our platform of choice.

**Work Division & Responsibilities******:
As from our meeting, the work was divided as:

Yaoqiang (Luke): Data Engineer responsible for data creation and preprocessing.
Tamara & Rishabh: ML Engineers in charge of implementing the machine learning model.
Aayush: Backend Engineer tasked with developing the inference service.
Varun: MLOps Engineer, overlooking deployment and CI/CD

Our meetings served as a platform to discuss progress, brainstorm ideas, set up ToDos, and divide work for the coming week. We made discussions on model type, data creation, and task distribution for a each weeks delivery and assiged the tasks to the corresponding team member. In terms of individual contributions, Luke took charge of dataset creation, while Tamara and Rishabh began implementing the ML models. Aayush dived deep into backend development, and Varun focused on deployment essentials.

**Deviations**:
While our orignial workflow was mostly outlined in our initial workflow, a few adaptions were made in response to some challenges we faced. For instance, we initially underestimated the complexity of model deployment, leading us to revisit and refine our approach. Additionally, We had believed that the complexity of our data wouldn't necessarily to be a large dataset. However, as we delved deeper into the implementation phase, it became an evidence that It is important to get a larger dataset. So we spent a bit more time on collecting and generating the dataset.
