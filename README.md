##### Organisation

Pushing changes:
- Each member has own branch to work on.
- Once changes complete in private branch, merge to development.
- Near to due date, once **everything** is complete, we will merge it to main branch and tag for submission.

Files:
- Meeting notes will go to folder meeting-notes (obviously!)
- You can share artefacts, code or any other externals material for research purposes in ideas folder under miscellaneous. Diagrams will also go to miscellaneous.
- Wiki for the project repo can be used to upload the notes you are making on the feature you have worked on. (not sure how it is linked to commits yet, let me know if you know how to add it.)
- Design decisions can also be added to architecture direc under misc. (or wiki, pick wherever seems the best on a team level.)

* When we make the final report, we can rearrange the repo. For now, this is done for ease of use.
